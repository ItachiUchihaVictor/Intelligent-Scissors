# Intelligent-Scissors
The program is to help people cut a region of interest from an image just like the Photoshop.
intelligent_scissor.cpp is the main application source file.

# Prerequisite 

OpenCV (see how to install it on the webpage http://opencv.org/)

# Notes

This program is developed under Windows but could work smoothly under Linux with some minor changes. 

By default, the program takes "ferry.tmp" as input. You may modify the input of this problem as you need by changing Line 3-4 of intelligent_scissor.cpp.
